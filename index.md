# About

Howdy! I'm Herkko. 

I'm a student specializing in Cyber Security at Jyväskylä University of Applied Sciences. I envision a world where IT systems and their administration operate seamlessly, with reliability and security at the forefront.  

I have gained expertise in various roles within the cyber security and IT industry. I've worked as a software developer with the [Finnish Defence Forces](https://puolustusvoimat.fi/en/frontpage) where I gained a recommendation for professionalism and diligence, served as a Junior DevOps Engineer at [Wimma Lab](https://www.wimmalab.org/). Currently, I'm involved in training organizations to respond to cyber threats at [JYVSECTEC](https://jyvsectec.fi/).  

At Next [Gen Hack FI](https://nextgenhack.fi/), I've been at the forefront of an exciting movement to support young, aspiring individuals interested in pursuing a career in cybersecurity. Additionally, I've had the privilege of serving as a dedicated mentor, assisting students at [The Student Union of JAMK University of Applied Sciences](https://www.jamko.fi/en/) in their educational journeys. These experiences have been integral to my mission of fostering growth and nurturing talent in the ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity and education.

You can find my CV [here](cv/). I also host an IT and cyber related blog [here](https://aa2958.github.io/blog), where I write about my experiences and other cyber security related topics.

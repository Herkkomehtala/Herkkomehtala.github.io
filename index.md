# About

Howdy! I'm Herkko. 

I'm a student pursuing a degree in Information and Communication Technology Engineering at Jyväskylä University of Applied Sciences. I envision a world where IT systems and their administration operate seamlessly, with reliability and security at the forefront.  

I have experience in various roles within the cybersecurity and IT industry. I've worked as a software developer with the [Finnish Defence Forces](https://puolustusvoimat.fi/en/frontpage) where I gained a recommendation for professionalism and diligence, served as a Junior DevOps Engineer at [Wimma Lab](https://www.wimmalab.org/), and currently, I'm employed at [JYVSECTEC](https://jyvsectec.fi/), where I'm involved in training organizations to respond to cyber threats.  

Additionally, I've also worked as a peer tutor at [The Student Union of JAMK University of Applied Sciences](https://www.jamko.fi/en/) and as an assistant organizer at [Next Gen Hack FI](https://nextgenhack.fi/), aiming to support young individuals interested in pursuing a career in cybersecurity.  

You can find my CV [here](cv/). I also host an IT and cyber related blog [here](https://aa2958.github.io/blog), where I write about my experiences and other things that interest me.
